# Depth Estimation

- Fundamental task in cv
- concentrate more on frame-based cameras

## Problems

- No investigation use spiking cameras to conduct Depth Prediction
  - stationary scenes are unsuitable for spike streams generated by spiking camera

## Challenges to Learn depth from asynchronous spike streams

1. Lack of unified backbone for spike data.
    - high temporal resolution due to dense spike stream
    - no standard network at hand that can simultaneously mine the spatial and temporal featues from stream.
2. Lack of spike depth dataset
   - sophisticated to calibrate(synchronize the time) the image windows and synchronize the timestampes between spiking and depth cameras
